# SDXL-Style-presets
A preset collection of styles to be used with SDXL Prompt Styler. They are nothing special. Just key words that influence the generated images which I enjoy using.

These require:

ComfyUI - https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI

SDXL Prompt Styler - https://github.com/twri/sdxl_prompt_styler

Place the file https://github.com/zzubnik/SDXL-Style-presets/blob/main/sdxl_styles_1zz.json in: \ComfyUI\custom_nodes\sdxl_prompt_styler
